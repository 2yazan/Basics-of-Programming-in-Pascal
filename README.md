# Basics of Programming in Pascal Language

This repository contains lab works completed as part of the **Basics of Programming in Pascal Language** course.

## Lab Work 1: Programming Algorithms with a Linear Structure
Find the domain of admissible values (ОДЗ).

---

## Lab Work 2: Programming Algorithms with Branching Structures
Given four real numbers (a, b, c, d), check their arrangement:
- If they are in non-increasing order, replace each number with the largest one.
- If they are in non-decreasing order, leave the numbers unchanged.
- Otherwise, replace all the numbers with their squares.

---

## Lab Work 3: Programming Algorithms with Cyclic Structures
Given an integer `n` (a non-negative number), determine whether this number `n` is a palindrome.

---

## Lab Work 4: Working with One-Dimensional Arrays Using Subroutines
Given a sequence of numbers:
- If the sequence is neither in non-decreasing order nor in non-increasing order, find the geometric mean of the positive elements.

---

## Lab Work 5: Working with Two-Dimensional Arrays Using Subroutines
Determine whether a given square matrix is orthonormal (a matrix where the dot product of each pair of different rows is 0 and the dot product of each row with itself is 1).

---

## Lab Work 6: String Processing
In the given string, words are separated by commas and spaces. Determine the number of palindrome words that start with the letter "a".

---

## Lab Work 7: Using Recursive Procedures and Functions
- **Task 1**: Given the denominator (common ratio) and the first term of a geometric progression, calculate the `n`-th term of the progression.
- **Task 2**: Same as Task 1, but using a recursive function.

## Lab Work 8: Using Combined Types
Find the sum of `n` fractions represented as irreducible fractions. Each fraction should be represented using two fields: numerator and denominator. Subroutines are used for input, output, reducing fractions, and calculating their sum.

---

## Lab Work 9: Bitwise Operations in Pascal
Given a text that ends with a period, output the vowels that appear in more than one word.

---

## Lab Work 10: Using Set Types
In a text file, replace consecutive identical characters with a single character.

---

## Lab Work 11: Processing Text Files
Given a file whose components are integers, transform the file by removing duplicate occurrences of the same number.
